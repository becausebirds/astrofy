title: "Survey of the Lesser Goldfinch for Audubon Climate Watch 2023"
description: "Since 2016, volunteers across the United States have participated in the Climate Watch survey to collect data about target species to help Audubon scientists better understand how birds are responding to climate change. This summer was my first opportunity to work with the Bexar Audubon Society to get involved and collect this crucial data about the Lesser Goldfinch."
